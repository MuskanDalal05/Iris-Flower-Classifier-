🌸 Iris Flower Classifier

This is a simple machine learning project that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — using the classic Iris dataset 📊. The model uses four features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width 🌼. It's built using Python 🐍 and scikit-learn 🤖, making it a great beginner-friendly project for those learning data science or machine learning.

The dataset contains 150 samples 📦, each labeled with one of the three species 🏷️. It is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 📁 and is widely used for educational purposes. The project includes data exploration, model training, evaluation, and prediction steps 🔍. Common algorithms like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, or Support Vector Machines are used to train the classifier 🧠, and the model achieves high accuracy — around 97% in typical cases ✅.

To use the project, simply clone the repository ⬇️, optionally create a virtual environment 💻, and install the dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt 📦. You can run the model using a Jupyter Notebook 📓 (iris_classifier.ipynb) or as a standalone Python script 🐍. The project includes visualizations 📈 and evaluation metrics like a confusion matrix.
